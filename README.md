Surf's Up



Review weather patterns in Hawaii as we are planning to open a surf and ice cream shop, this project is designed to examine the weather data of both June and December in the local area. By looking at the dataframes of these two months from our datasets. We should be able to assess if our shop would have an ideal weather condition to operate in.
